I promised something more colourful, so here it is&mdash;and I actually took this picture today. <br><br>No, not one of my delicious [Muji meals](http://www.muji.net/store/pc/user/foods/index.html) but a plastic replica of what's on the menu inside. There's a lot of this here, and when it's not in full 3D as here it's very brightly photographed on a display board (I'll get a picture).  This seems to be true even if the restaurant is fairly fancy, and most of the time the photography looks like a MacDonalds menu more than anything else, so you can't help but think that the real thing will be disappointing compared to the (generally awful) pictures.  Mostly, I think it's the other way around: the real thing is better than the pictures.  <br><br>By the way my guess is that the price is 150Â¥ (Yen) per skewer, not the whole plate or you'd not find me eating anywhere else.<br><br>Under-promise, over-deliver, the secret to successful business.
