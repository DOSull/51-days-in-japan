That's not a picture caption but a diary entry. I very nearly ended up stranded out at the far-flung Kashiwa campus. Weather was fine in the morning, hence no umbrella. Probably a bit under-dressed, but I've been finding it warm, with all the charging around you have to do, especially getting the subway and train to the back of beyond.

Anyway, at about 2:30 just off skyping to Fintan, who had remarked how bright the room was, the sky suddenly darkened, and within minutes there was an apocalyptic thunderstorm with hail. And the temperature had dropped about 10 degrees. The way it was raining and me under-equipped I might have had to camp out, but it ended more or less as quickly as it had started, and I took my chance and headed back to the station (I already had my airfare money safely in my wallet by then...).

Anyway, as promised yesterday, this is in [Harajuku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harajuku), famed for [Gwen Stefani's 'Harajuku Girls'](http://www.allmusic.com/album/r715173) which isn't really what it sounds like&mdash;a tribute to the Japanese teen fashion scene, really. Anyway, it's clearly the place to be on a Saturday. I didn't venture down this street. No idea what all the excitement is about.
