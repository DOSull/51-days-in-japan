Much as I dislike that movie, it makes a good headline. This is Tokyo's copy of the [Richard Indiana sculpture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Love_sculptures) more often associated with the States. As that link shows there are quite a few of them around it wouldn't make a bad project to try to visit them all. I've seen two this year (there's one on 6th Avenue), hurrah for me!

This is in Shinjuku, last weekend, looking uncharacteristically sunny, and also uncharacteristically empty. The emptiness is deceptive, there are probably 5000 people underneath the ground I'm standing on, it being that kind of place.

Not far from here I found the Paul Bassett Australian coffee place, after quite a bit of searching, and having alost given up on it. Why are things always in the last place you look? (Riddle for you there, Fintan.) It did a decent flat white, but nothing really to write home about (Australian, after all...), and I'm not so surprised as all that that he has closed two of his three Tokyo outlets, if they're all as hard to find as this one!

This was also near the Sompo Gallery with the $40,000,000 Van Gogh Sunflowers, from back in the bubble years. Impressive picture, but a bit over-priced, I feel. The gallery was disappointing as its permanent collection of Seiji Togo's works (probably Japan's premier impressionist-post-impressionist 20th century painter) was locked away to allow a ho-hum impressionist exhibition of Le Sidaner (who he?) which was pleasant enough, but nothing I hadn't seen before. There I go getting blas√© about art galleries. More to come on that front tomorrow...
