As it has been raining again, and after a good run, I seem to have run out of pictures again, I thought I'd post this one, which is actually from way back when it seemed like it was never going to stop raining. She's wearing a face mask! Probably 1 in 10 people are wearing them. I think it's just something people who have colds do, or possibly people with allergies wear them to help with that. You can buy the masks in packs of seven (obviously) and they aren't that expensive. It makes you feel very self-conscious about coughing or even clearing your throat, when other people are going to this sort of trouble. Such a strange contrast with the Chinese and their famed spitting. Still a bit odd though, to Western eyes, at any rate.

Must stock up on more photos at the weekend, or I'll never get through the next 18 days...
