This just in from the blase about museums desk...

You could post a picture every day for a decade of a slightly wonky sign somewhere in Tokyo.  Given the parlous (that would be nonexistent) state of my Japanese this is not mocking, I just found the directness of this sign, in front of the National Museum, rather amusing. I was half expecting to see a shark's fin cruising around in there.

The museum itself was rather fine. Enormously generously proportioned in a city where space is at a premium, but all the better for it. And full of very beautiful things, very much along the lines you might expect: Japanese swords with their fantastic gentle curves, ceramics, lacquerware, kimonos, masks, wall hangings, screens, fans, and so on. I was a bit lacking for context to put it all in, but it was still a diverting hour or two.

What is rather odd is how that gracious, classic aesthetic can possibly go with the general aesthetic craziness of contemporary Japan. I can see the classic 'zen' aesthetic in things like Muji, Miyake, CdG, but it's harder to spot in Fridgeezoo animals (which are comparatively tasteful), manga, anime, neon, and the general visual and aural assault that is wandering around Tokyo of an afternoon. There must be some interesting theories on how that works. It's the same contradiction between the calm, ordered, Muji-storage-nirvana and the piles of crazy junk that you can buy everywhere.

Oh well, just enjoy it while I'm still here.

This evening in Tokyu Hands, Shinjuku (not my favourite branch but certainly my favourite store&mdash;if they opened one in Auckland, about half a dozen NZ chains would be out of business overnight) I saw make-your-own snowglobe equipment. Not novelty kits, equipment, which suggests that people have this as a hobby. If I were seeing Caro any time soon, I'd have been tempted...
