It took me a little while to figure it out, but here's my rendition of an origami kiwi, based on information I was able to dig up online about [this model](http://design.origami.free.fr/bestof/diaz/Kiwi/Kiwi%20p%20Nicolas.jpg), which is much better made than my effort. I know what you're thinking: \"It has Yoda's hands for feet\". No? Just me then.<br><br>Well, now I've figured it out I'll make another to present to [Atsu Okabe](http://home.csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~atsu/index.html), when I meet him on Tuesday.  I'm looking forward to that meeting&mdash;everyone here still speaks very highly of him, and most of them were taught by him.  He wrote (with others) the book [__Spatial Tessellations__](http://home.csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~atsu/Voronoi/index.html), which is almost the platonic ideal of an authorative academic work.  People will still be citing it in 100 years' time.<br><br>Anyhow, must get on with my day, so I can restock on photos not taken on campus for the week ahead!
