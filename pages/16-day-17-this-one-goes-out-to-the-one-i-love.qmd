Picture of Muji requested by Gill (I have others) so here's one.  As always with these interior pictures in shops, I feel like an industrial spy, and not being able to use the flash (out of consideration for others) they don't necessarily come out so well.<br><br>Anyway, immaculately arranged shelves, so much so that I'd be afraid to buy anything, especially anything breakable, like this lot.  I assume that the sign says something about getting help rather than trying to grab a stack of eight plates yourself.<br><br>My 'local' Muji is [this one in Yurakucho](http://www.mujiyurakucho.com) and features food, clothes, furniture, homeware of all sorts, cosmetics, spectacles, stationery (surprisingly little), bicycles, and ... well, that's about it.  It's a but M&S really, but with that sort of effortless attention to detail that they do so well here.  It is all a bit samey though.  I'm not sure how you would tell if they'd changed any of the stock.  But maybe that's the point.<br><br>Yourakucho is an interesting spot.  It's just next to a big railway viaduct several tracks across which are going into Tokyo JR station, and there's a whole succession of tiny little bars under the arches.  I imagine they are full of salary-men at the end of the working day during the week grabbing a quick drink or several before the last train home&mdash;bit like London, really.  Another block over and you're on to the main drag through Ginza which is offices and lot of upmarket shopping.
