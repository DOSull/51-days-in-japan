Interesting day today. Day 1 of the U Tokyo festival, which is a Freshers' Fair of some kind, I think. There had been something brewing for a week or two when a temporary construction site appeared on my walk to the office, and then a couple of days ago lots of frantic activity started with students in syncrhonised T-shirts showing up at the construction hut and painting, hammering, sawing, and generally up to something. Turns out they were building stalls and display boards.

Then yesterday seemingly 200+ food stalls got assembled overnight&mdash;not super-interesting food, but a fair variety&mdash;and since this morning it's been all go. I've seen the UT double dutch team (yes skipping and rapping, look it up boys), their glee club, their South American music club, a couple of indie bands, traditional drummers, the lacrosse team, and people dressed up as pandas, carrots, manga characters, in kimonos, boys in kimonos, and more or less everyone wearing various club T-shirts (many of them in amusing Janglish).

I think there is another day of it tomorrow. They do nothing by halves here.

The photo was taken through a long horizontal slot in the outer wall of [Fukutake Hall](http://architecturerevived.blogspot.jp/2011/12/fukutake-hall-university-of-tokyo-hongo.html) which is one of the few genuinely interesting buildings on the campus, even if it doesn't look like much. Anyway, the camera's panorama view did its best, but of course, the people are moving, so it doesn't really work. A bit different though. You should click on the picture to see a more zoomed in view.
