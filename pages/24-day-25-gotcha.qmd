I mentioned the crows on about the second day I was here&mdash;great big black crows. Not in huge numbers, but enough so you notice. I've been trying to get a picture the whole time I've been here, and finally one of them stayed still enough for long enough, and also in a well-lit spot. When they're in the shade they sort of swallow up all the light like a Lord of the Rings black rider, and you get rubbish photos.

Anyway, that's about the size of it. Apparently they are a problem, although I suspect only if you decide you don't like them much. As usual, when an animal is doing well around humans, it is generally the humans who are to blame. Here, with 30 million people in a not very big area, there is a lot of garbage, and surprisingly, most of it is left out in plastic bags for collection. The council made some sort of rule about the bags being transparent, and crows are pretty smart, so they do well out of this arrangement. Bins would probably solve the problem, but might be difficult to deal with in Tokyo's narrow and oomplicated streets, although like I said, [crows are pretty smart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PmkreJHw4k&feature=related), [really smart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbBBSBaEBQU&feature=related), so they might figure bins out, anyway.

There has been war on the crows for some years now, but I don't think they're having much luck.

There's been an arthouse documentary about it all called [Tokyo Waka](http://www.stylofilms.com/tokyowaka.html) which looks really interesting.

I like them. They know what they are about and they look pretty cool too. Of course, I might feel a bit differently if one attacked me, which apparently does happen during breeding season...
