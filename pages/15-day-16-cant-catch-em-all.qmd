We all know this is why I'm here anyway.<br><br>I felt a bit like I was doing industrial espionage taking photos inside a shop, and without the flash this didn't come out as well as I would've liked, but there you go.  <br><br>There are polar bears, walruses, penguins, seals, tigers (which we've got), pigs, cows, and squirrels.  I like the note on the box, \"animals suddenly come to live in fridges\".
