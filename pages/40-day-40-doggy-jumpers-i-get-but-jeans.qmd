Again, from Omotesando. Somehow I'd like to imagine that dressing dogs up like this would offend Japanese aesthetic sensibilities, but it seems not. Admittedly, this is an extreme example.

The sharp-eyed will notice an umbrella in the background doing parasol duty on a sunny day. I'm just thankful the dogs haven't got umbrellas too.
