Another one of those graffiti artists from the 'Exit Through the Gift Shop' movie, Shepard Fairey has obviously been here with his stencil of the Andre the Giant poster image. This was near Aoyama Dori in Ometosdando. Always odd how this expensive neighbourhoods have this strange relationship with 'art' and things 'radical', I think.
