During my walk on Sunday, I crossed [Aoyama Cemetery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aoyama_Cemetery) between Omotesando and Roppongi. It's surprisingly large given the value of land around there, and also pleasantly quiet away from the surrounding crowds and urban hubbub. Anyway, I paused for a drink of water, looked up and this is what I saw. Strange coincidence, really. William Henry Stone of Sligo, Ireland.

I've done a bit of poking around on the web, and there was a Freemason of that name in Japan that fits the time frame. He was a telecommunications engineer, and according to the inscription, for \"45 years a loyal servant of his Imperial Japanese Majesty's government\". fairly like that he's one of only a small number of Europeans buried there, so weird that I should glance up and see this!
