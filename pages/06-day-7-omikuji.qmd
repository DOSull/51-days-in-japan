This was at the [Buddhist shrine on Sunday](http://g.co/maps/asyxp).  It's the place in the middle of the map with the backwards swastika thingummy (there's a reason for that, which is explained [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika)).<br><br>These pieces of paper are called *omikuji* and are fortunes that people give a small donation to receive.  They then leave the bad fortunes behind at the shrine.  I guess they take the good ones home.  There's information about [how it all works here](http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/shrine-guide-2.shtml#luckycharms).<br><br>It's pretty amazing that people go to the trouble of folding and tieing the pieces of paper up so precisely. <br><br>I like the abstract texture that the whole thing makes&mdash;and also that it's paper!
