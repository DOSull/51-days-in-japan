Yet more Omotesando. This is the Dior shop halfway along Omotesando on the Harajuku side. Can't imagine what they do at Christmas to make it look more festive. 

This shopping street is beyond any reasonable comparison that I can think of: Dior, Ralph Lauren, Issey Miyake, Prada, Gucci, Bulgari, Louis Vuitton, Agnes B, Commes des Garcons, Emporio Armani, Paul Smith... and so on and on and on. That's just the obvious shops with their own frontage. There are several flash malls on the same strip and that's before you even get into the sidestreets which are full of boutiques. All of it is of course eye-wateringly expensive. Hard to say if anyone actually buys anything or not, but there's a fair amount of foot traffic on the weekend.

This is where the private university Aoyama Gakuin that Atsu Okabe teaches at now is to be found. I expect that keeping the (presumably) wealthy students 'off the streets' is a challenge. He and his wife were lovely when I met them last night, very friendly and keen that my family come over next time, so we can all go walking in the mountains. I will be owing a number of people a meal out when they show up in New Zealand. Everyone refuses to let me pay for anything (\"You are the guest\" it's always very final, no discussion to be had).
