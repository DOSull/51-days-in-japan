I said that I went wandering in the imperial palace park at the centre of the city on Sunday. Looking at my guide book I think I probably missed ssme of the better bits, because I was rushing a bit to get back for a 'date' with Fintan... anyway, it was still pretty impressive. Not the least of it was the strangely calm park with really very few people and not much happening, contrasted with the general mayhem and crowds that you tend to run into everywhere else you go. This picture shows a part of the gate complex near the entrance, with Nihombashi the financial district looming not far off behind. I think that big block is the HQ of the Sumitomo-Mitsui Banking Corporation and there is a lot of that just a (long) stone's throw away across the still-impressive moat that surrounds the palace complex.

It's a bit like an odd cross between the City of London and the financial district in Manhattan. They have the old building part of London, but across the road its long skyscraper canyons, rather than London's maze of streets.

On the left you can see the walls that make the outer ramparts of the complex. They're made out of huge blocks of stone. They've been restoring them, but even where they are damaged, they're still impressive considering that some of it goes back to the seventeenth century.

On a Sunday they close off the road around this to traffic except cyclists and then ruin the experience for pedestrians by insisting that you still use the crossings&mdash;$which are still set to their miserly long-timing cycles for when it's busy with traffic.

Off tomorrow to stock up on more pictures for the week ahead. Maybe by then the camera's GPS will have caught up to where I am; this shot is showing Shinjuku from the day before&mdash;it really is rubbish at getting a fix.
