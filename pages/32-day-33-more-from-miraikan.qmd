So before the eclipse so rudely interrupted, I had been going to post this picture from the Science Museum of the Geo-Cosmos exhibit, which is the giant globe-shaped LED display mounted in the mezzanine space between the 3rd and 5th floors, and suspended above the 1st, so there were people down below gawking up at it as well.  The scale is a little hard to fathom, unless you see it live, but it must be 5 metres diameter, and it's covered in the latest, greatest LED display technology, which is doubtless coming to a TV set near you some day soon, so you'll have to throw you're only recently acquired flat screen and buy something else.<br><br>Anyway, even post-eclipse, in retrospect it was still impressive.  Easy to get a little off-hand about all this stuff after a while.  There is a lot of it around in this city.  Of note, is the crowd.  This is about as many people as I have seen in a museum since I've been here.  They're pretty good places for escaping from the crowds, believe it or not.  I don't know what people do on the weekend, but it's not go to museums.  Shop, would have to be my guess, so not much different from Aucklanders then...<br><br>It was raining all day today.  Bit of a rubbish day really, with that and hitting a bit of roadblock writing chapter 4.
