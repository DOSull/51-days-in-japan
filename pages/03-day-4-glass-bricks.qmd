They like their glass bricks on the campus buildings, but nowhere more so than Engineering Building 14 which is where I'll be going tomorrow to see Asami-san (Prof Yasushi Asami).  Mostly the main campus buildings are pretty ugly though, functional rather than interesting to look at a but like it was at Penn State.
