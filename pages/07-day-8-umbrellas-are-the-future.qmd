I wasn't expecting this.

It's been raining a fair bit since I got here, but more today than before. And now it is clear that everyone here uses umbrellas, not waterproofs. And Japan is the future, or [so says William Gibson](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/apr/01/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror.features) and [he should know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson). 

So umbrellas are the future.

This is the lobby of the building with the glass bricks from [Day 4](03-day-4-glass-bricks.qmd) and because everyone uses them (mine's the blue one at the back) they have to be dried off and of course, if noone steals stuff, well why not leave them sitting around like this? There are some other oddities arising from the same cause&mdash;umbrellas, that is, not the low crime rate. But we'll get to that.

There are more umbrellas in the future of this journal, this much I know.<br>
