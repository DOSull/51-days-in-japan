The University of Tokyo campus is a curious mixture of mundane modern, and not-quite-right _faux_ art-deco (a lot of it got rebuilt after a big earthquake in the 1920s). 

There's also a clear attempt to ape something of the Oxbridge feel in parts. Mostly, it doesn't quite work, because oddly, a lot of it is not kept very well. In the evening, that's less obvious, and this is the one axis where it actually _does_ do exactly what it says on the tin.

The campus is pretty popular with dog walkers. Most of the dogs have outfits, and anything bigger than a labrador puppy is unusual, although I did see an Alsatian taking its owner for a walk the other day.
