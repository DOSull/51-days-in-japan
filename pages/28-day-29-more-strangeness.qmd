Don't get me wrong, unlike [yesterday's hyper-weirdness](/index.php?showimage=27), which I don't get on any level, I get this on some level.  <br><br>In a general sense though, I don't get any of this stuff.  People have really small houses and apartments, and I know they love their storage&mdash;you only need to [shop at Muji to see this](http://www.muji.net/store/pc/user/homewares/scene/storage.html)&mdash;but it really seems like they love to buy lots of stuff.  _I just don't know where it all goes_!  It made (sort of) sense in the US ([but not really](http://www.storyofstuff.org/movies-all/story-of-stuff/)) where everyone had a 3000 sq ft monster house to fill it up with crap.  But there are 22 sq m apartments here (100,000 yen a month, since you ask).  Where do they put all this stuff?  By the way it may interest you to know that [Muji now sell houses too](http://www.muji.net/store/pc/user/ie/kinoie.html).<br><br>Anyway, this thing I get.  It appeals to my inner geek.  It's a 100<sup>th</sup> scale model of dinosaurs.  They sell all sorts of things in this range.  I think you have to put it together yourself, but it's hard to tell.  They're not that expensive, so maybe I should get one (so we can fill out huge house with rubbish too...).  What makes this a little strange is that these things are presented as architectural models.  I'm not really sure why an architect would need a bumper pack of 1/100<sup>th</sup> scale T-Rexs to add to his model of a house.  It wouldn't really be for scale, since noone's ever seen a real one.  So I think, although it is presented as architectural, it's a hobby thing.<br><br>But there you have it: somewhat cool, slightly obsessive, and more than a little weird.<br><br>In other news, I have been invited to a 'beer party' on Thursday, and after a meeting with a professor (annoyingly out at Kashiwa) on Saturday next week, also for dinner, all the way back across town in Yoyogi.  Better than out there.  Could be an interesting meeting, they have very good data on Tokyo itself, business turnover rates across the city, all sorts.
