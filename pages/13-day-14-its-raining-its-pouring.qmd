I was feeling guilty about using photographs not taken on the day, since this is supposed to be a (sort of) diary, but it's been raining heavily for 24 hours now, so I'm over my guilt.  You can [check the rain radar here](http://www.jma.go.jp/en/radnowc/), but I expect it will be sunny by the time you do.<br><br>So this is another umbrella thing.  This is the entrance to Starbucks next to the building I'm working in.  Even more criminally expensive coffee than usual&mdash;380Â¥ for a tall (er... small) latte, which is almost six NZ dollars.<br><br>But I digress.  The mundane contraption pictured (the one on the left I mean) is, well... I don't know what it's called, but it sleeves your umbrella in a plastic bag, to stop it dribbling all over Starbucks' floor!  Also pictured: my umbrella so-attired.  <br><br>Somebody is making a living selling these things, I imagine.  If the Chinese get into umbrellas in anything like the way they have here, then [Blunt](http://www.bluntumbrellas.com/) that New Zealand company [Gill covered some time back](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/small-business/news/article.cfm?c_id=85&objectid=10743613) could be bigger than Fonterra by the end of the decade.  Or not.<br><br>In other news, there is no other news.  If current atmospheric conditions persist, I will run out of useable pictures by the weekend...
