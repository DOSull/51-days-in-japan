So, I thought I'd _try_ to post a picture every day I'm here, just so you can see some of what I'm seeing.  Since I'll try to post every day, many of the pictures will be odd little details I notice, not spectacular things or big things or incredible things, just all the little things that make it different being here to being in Auckland.<br><br>These are some fairly typical apartment blocks a few hundred metres south of Hongo-Sanchome subway station.  The thing I've started to notice is that a lot of these building are faced with tiles.  I think they must be pre-made panels finished in tiles.  It gives the buildings an interesting texture.  It also gives the street some interesting variations from one building to the next, even when the buildings (like these ones) are very similar to each other.
