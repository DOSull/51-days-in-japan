Back to the big smoke. 

This is Shinjuku on Sunday, but not at street level. There were lots of people (believe me) but one of the things about here is that you're missing most of it if you concentrate on the ground level. Of course, looking up makes you look like a gawping tourist&mdash;and it's also tricky to avoid running into people if you just look up, but it's worth it.

Shinjuku is yet another of those inner secondary centres. [Busiest rail station in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinjuku_Station), apparently. Something like 3.8 million passengers every day. There are around 200 entrances and exits to the whole station complex. It's a difficult thing to imagine until you've been amongst it, but here's a [visualization](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLNAcXca44Y) made by some of the people who work here at the University. I need to meet them, I think.

They close the main street off to traffic on Sundays so it it's not such a bad place for a stroll if you like your strolls with extra people. 

I had my first minor subway mishap here getting on an express not a local when I headed back to Hongo-Sanchome, but fortunately figured out a recovery plan and survived. I'll be more careful next time.
