An unexpected bonus this morning: a total eclipse of the sun! I was heading to the kitchen at about 7:05, and ran into Per Arne Rikvold a physicist from Florida State (from Norway originally). Per was very excited because an eclipse was coming at 7:34. So had a quick shower and got my camera. Suddenly, the annoying misalignment of the residence worked to our advantage. You see all the big windows are on the east side of the building, pointlessly lighting the corridor, while the west-facing rooms are like caves in the mornings. But one of the big corridor windows was a perfect vantage point. It was a little cloudy, and I would need a filter to get a good picture. I've done what I can with the computer to enhance the image, but it still only gives an impression. 

What surprised me, compared to the TV coverage we've seen of these is that it didn't get really dark. Partly, that may be the clouds scattering the light, and also making the contrast between full sun and eclipse less dramatic, but mostly, I think the TV footage makes it look darker than it really gets: it's more a twilight effect. It was still pretty exciting though!

The Japanese characters in the title mean solar eclipse and translate as 'day eater' or similar. Per has been coming here for years and has pretty good Japanese. Per and I have some interests in common&mdash;I will have to track him down and talk some more.
