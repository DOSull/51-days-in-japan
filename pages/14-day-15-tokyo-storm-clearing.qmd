This is (sort of) the view from my office window, if I crane around a bit.  But not really, I took this from the area by the lifts which is on the same side of the building and has a much bigger window than the office does.<br><br>It was dusk (I hope you can see) and the lights were just starting to come on.  This is about the first time in a week that the lights have been properly visible, there has been so much rain.  If I'd taken this any time in the last week it would've just been grey murk.<br><br>The wheel is a ferris wheel, and you can dimly also make out a rollercoaster, although I've not actually seen that in operation.  There is also a log flume at the complex which is called Laqua, and includes Seijo Ishii where I've been getting essential things European.  They've al handily got brand labels in roman lettering, but all the instructions and details have stuck on additional labels in Japanese.  Fair enough, they live here, after all.<br><br>That whole complex is about a kilometre from me, maybe a bit more.  The tall building is a hotel.  And the thing that looks vaguely like Vector Arena is the [Tokyo Dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome) which is a 42,000 seat baseball stadium.<br><br>I'm looking forward to more clear skies over the next week.  They surely couldn't be any less clear than they've been.  Maybe I'll get over my umbrella fixation.<br><br>Oh yeah, the crane in the foreground is pretty typical.  There's a fair amount of small scale building going on round and about.  They have to cram these tall cranes onto tiny sites.  It's a pity it's in the way of the picture, really!
