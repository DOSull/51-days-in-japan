Finally the 'real' Tokyo, eh? This is [Akihabara](http://g.co/maps/4qwur) at night&mdash;or early evening anyway. The occasion of my visit, a trip to Yodabashi Akihibara ([here's a much better picture than I could ever take](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:YodobashiAkiba.jpg)) was because my plug adapter broke. It was universal and had too many moving parts to last, so it was bound to happen. Just as well it was in Tokyo, and not ... well almost anywhere, come to think of it.

Akihibara is the heart of the Japanese retail electronics universe. Yodabashi alone has 9 floors, starting with computers and mobile phones on ground and up through video, cameras, household, stationery, toys, games... and I don't know what all else. There's a Tower Records inside, a huge book shop, an extensive telescopes section (?!) and model railways too. Nailcare products, foot baths, face-scrubbers, I could go on. Bewildering altogether. The building is a whole city block.

Found my adapter (eventually), bought two, hit the main drag, headed north (never could stand that dog). Every electronic device known to humanity is available on that street. There's a weird manga, anime thing going on too, which I don't get, but it means the whole place is _buzzing_. This is the future of which [William Gibson spoke](03-day-4-glass-bricks.qmd). I expect it's seething with umbrellas in the rain.

So appropriately enough, the picture was taken with the cell phone (in the future noone has a camera), which accounts for the, um... quality. It's looking back at the centre of it all from 300 metres up the road. Street lighting is not a problem. Something more serene tomorrow, I feel.
