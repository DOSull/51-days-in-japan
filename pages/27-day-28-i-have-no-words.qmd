This why I love Tokyo.  Where else would you see this?  <br><br>I really have very little idea what this thing is or what it is supposed to do, as it didn't seem to be turned on at the time, but I think that it is a music system (all those podiums the musicians are standing on are speakers) and that the little musicians move around when the music plays.  Or something.  Anyway, clearly a must-have for any adult lifestyle in the den.  Or perhaps not.  This item was on 'open sale' which I took to mean that they would welcome any offers to take it off their hands.  There were also some very expensive, very small (like 30cm) grand pianos in the same display.<br><br>This was yet another giant [we-sell-almost-everything-that-needs-electricity](http://ikebukuro.areablog.jp/upload/100109/blog/post/2009102414957CxjIw.JPG) place, this time in [Ikebukuro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikebukuro), which is yet another subcity centre the size of Manchester (or bigger).  A more down-to-earth sort of place than Shinjuku or Shibuya, it seemed a bit more down-at-heel, and definitely had a slightly seamier side to the north of the station.  I failed to find the place I was looking for, but will go back.<br><br>Currently desperate to get a picture of someone in a mask.  I think the only way will be to hang out in large crowds&mdash;it doesn't feel right snapping people when it is obvious you are doing it... although I don't suppose it's any more right to do it when they don't.
