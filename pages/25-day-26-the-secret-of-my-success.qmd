I just realised that you have seen no pictures of the transport system...<br><br>The picture shows why it is that I am able to get around reasonably successfully.  This is the information board at Hongo-Sanchome (local metro station), with, from left to right, a list of which exit you need for which local facilities, a map of the exits and where you need to go to get to them, clear arrows pointing you to any connecting stations, and then a map of the line.  All this information in both Japanese and English, which is pretty good of them, when you think about it.<br><br>Of course, it's a bit more complicated than this at some of the bigger stations...<br><br>While I am on the subject of transport, [this video](http://vimeo.com/37790190) is worth a look<br><br>It's raining again, so there might be a few more of these, and/or umbrellas.
