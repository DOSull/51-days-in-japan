__Much__ more raw fish in every sense. I actually shouldn't have been here as it turned out. The Tsukiji Wholesale fish market has a first-come first-ticketed (starting at 5am) policy for the tuna auctions. I wasn't interested in that because it's before the subway opens and seemed like a bit of a lottery (who wants to get up at 4 only to be disappointed?). But I did want to go to the fish market, so I set the alarm for 5 and decided to see how I felt when it went off. Not so bad I couldn't get up, so I headed off. It's about twenty minutes from here on the Oedo line.

Well... what a place. As usual in Tokyo, enormous. Clearly a working market and not really for tourists. I somehow managed not to be given one of the leaflets they were handing out at the entrance which indicated that the wholesale market area is closed to visitors until 9:00 (it was about 6:15), and ended up wandering in there. It's pretty hair-raising: dozens of electric buggy transport things that are pinging around at top speed (nearest thing I've seen to a traffic jam while here). Lots of stalls, lots of fish of all shapes and sizes. Huge knives, and lots of business going on.

Anyway, I was taking photos, and then got shoulder-tapped by a very affable security person, who gave me one of the leaflets I had missed out on and pointed out my mistake. Oh well, I got some pictures anyhow, and it would otherwise have been a slightly disappointing more touristy market area that I'd have been restricted to. Still interesting, but rather sanitised&mdash;places selling only sushi seaweed, bowls, implements and so forth, but not actual fish!

Fairly amazing the see this all happening and to think that meals like the one in yesterday's photo had probably been in Tsukiji that morning and in the ocean not long before that.
