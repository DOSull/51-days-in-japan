I have pictures somewhere in the house of views across Glasgow's Necropolis one New Year's Day (1997, I think) with Gabrielle and Roni, across the headstones and obelisks and so on to the tower blocks in the background.  Here's the Japanese version.  Aoyama Cemetery from last weekend again, and a bit less inhospitable than Glasgow in January, but same idea really.  \"A man's a man for a' that\", as Rabbie Burns would have it.
