... and thanks for all the fish.  Some live ones to leave with.  I have quite a number of photos of carp in my camera, but this is the best taken just a couple of days ago at the SensÅ-ji h temple complex in Asakusa.  <br><br>I stopped off there on the way back into town from far-flung Kashiwa where I'd been dropping off keys and returning health insurance and ID cards and signing yet more forms (even unto the last day).  Asakusa has been a tourist spot for years because of the huge temple (you'll have to wait until I get home for those pictures), various knick-knacks in numerous shops (including the plastic food menu items).  It's now even more of a draw because it's close to the Sky Tree, which opened on 22 May and had 1.6 million visitors in its first week (you pick your lower jaw up off the floor now).<br><br>Anyhow, there are always koi (Japanes carp or [nishikigoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koi)) in the ponds in the ceremonial gardens.  The ones at Ueno Park seem to have reverted to a duller colour, probably because the crows and herons would soon eat them all if they were this brightly coloured.  These are the most brightly coloured I've seen.  According to wikipedia, they recognise people and can be trained to eat from your hand.  There are spas where you can have them nibble your toes.<br><br>Odd that the Japanese will eat almost anything from the sea, but these guys are sacrosanct.<br><br>So that's it from me from Japan.  See you on the other side.<br>
