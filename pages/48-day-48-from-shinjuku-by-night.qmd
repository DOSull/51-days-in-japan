I'm glad give the recent rain that I decided to go and get my Tokyo by night landscape on Monday. This is from the Metropolitan Government office tower which has a free observatory. Unfortunately they have cordoned off the best bit of the view for a crappy bar, but I guess that's why it's free. Still you get the idea...
