Not the first time, but the first time I remembered my tourist duty and took a picture. I think there are three kinds of tuna, salmon, octopus, squid, bonito and a couple of other things on here too. All just as good to eat as they look. This was a nice bar-restaurant, but it didn't seem overly swanky, relatively straightforward. Amazingly filling to eat, and they take their time over the food. All that moving it from plate to bowl, to soy sauce, all with chopsticks takes time. A nice ritual and a nicely slowed down way to be in at-times rather frantic place. After that, back on the JR Sobu Line from Inage to Tokyo and the Maranouchi to Hongo-Sanchome, so no rest for very long!
