I suppose this proves what a geek I am, but these signs impress me tremendously.

This was on the platform at Nogizaka on the Chiyoda line (some days ago, I think on my way back from [Roppongi and the Mori Art Centre](22-day-23-to-infinity-and-beyond.qmd). You can tell, because that's the station in red text, with no number beside it. The numbers tell you how many minutes to each stop. You look at where you are going. I was heading for Yushima, one of four stationswithin about ten minutes walk of campus&mdash;the others are Hongo-Sanchome, Nezu and Todaimae. I only got around to using Nezu for the first time today. 

Anyway look across from for the station you are heading to, and it tells you which car to get in on the train so that you are near the exits or the escalator for changing lines depending on what you want to do. This tells me that my destination is 15 minutes away (which is pretty much exactly how long it will take, and that cars 1 or 10 are near the exits. If I read Japanese, then I imagine that there is more detail about which exits each end of the train are nearest to. It means you can be using the system like a long-time resident in no time. It took me about two years in London to remember which cars to get in for rapid exit at different stations.
