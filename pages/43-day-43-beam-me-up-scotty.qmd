This is the Campus Refectory, where I've been getting lunch quite a bit.  It's underground, and you walk across this 'bridge' over the seating area beneath on both sides, arriving at the 'menu' which is actually a display case full of numbered plastic replicas of the meals available.  You then go to a vending machine punch in the number, pay, and get a ticket which you take to one of the service counters down below.  It's really very strange, but quite endearing, and the food is cheap, good and fairly plentiful too.  I should try and get a shot with a proper camera (this was my phone), as this doesn't really give the full effect.  Even so, you can probably appreciate how very, uh..., _Japanese_ this is.
