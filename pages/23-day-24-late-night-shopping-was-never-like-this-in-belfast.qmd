This is Shibuya at about 9:45pm on Sunday night, on my way back from my meal with my host and his family in Sangen-jaya.  It's quite something, and it's nothing like as deranged as Shinjuku, which I will have to brave some night to get a similar picture.  Still thousands of people out and about, up to I'm not really sure what, but all seemingly enjoying themselves.  <br><br>You can see why the sci-fi people take so much inspiration from Tokyo, although at the same time, for me at least, it's hard to see why they always use it as a dystopian vision&mdash;this is really cool, if you ask me.  If this is what urban super-density makes, then let's have more of it, is what I say.  What's not to like?<br><br>It's funny to think that all the energy being saved on not driving everywhere seems to have been diverted into neon...<br><br>The meal was Italian in a place called Chiasso, and was very good.  My first alcohol in a while, over three weeks, and I found myself to be drinking slowly.  Interesting.<br><br>I saw Prof Asami's home, which was also interesting, not as small as I had imagined it might be, especially considering that they live only two stops from Shibuya, and so are really very central.  He grew up in the neighbourhood, went to the same elementary school as his five year old daughter attends now, and his wife is from Shibuya, so a local girl.  Tokyo-ites, I suppose, and perhaps that's how they are lucky enough to be in a reasonable size of a place (like born and bred Londoners).<br><br>Sangen-jaya was a really nice neighbourhood.  The main station entrance and immediate surrounds rather blighted by a [huge motorway overpass](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3220/2291488780_27721c2b96.jpg) but duck down a side-street and within seconds you wouldn't know it was there, and the place is full of little locally owned shops, bars, restaurants and so on.  They do that a lot&mdash;put rail or road on stilts down the middle of other major roads.  It shouldn't really work, but on the other hand, all it does is add some more hubbub to an already busy place, and maybe that's better than carving things through residential neighbourhoods, just making the disruption extend even further. <br><br>Anyway, time for bed.
