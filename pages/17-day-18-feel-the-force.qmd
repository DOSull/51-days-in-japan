Here's one for the boys. I had this set of instructions for an origami yoda with me&mdash;I got it from [here](http://www.spitenet.com/origami/Yoda-v.shtml). The design is by Fumiaki Kawahata. I got some paper a couple of days ago, and persistence eventually paid off, although I could use some light paper that would hold the folds a bit better, otherwise he'll never close up his cloak.

The paper is Japanese, origami is Japanese, and the designer is Japanese, so I'm going to treat this as part of my diary.

Enjoy!
