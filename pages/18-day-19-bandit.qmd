On my walk from Shibuya to Shinjuku on Saturday, in addition to probably seeing about 250,000 people (I have photographic evidence of many of them) I saw some funny little places.<br><br>This is a toy shop, which claims to sell a selection.  I don't see a whole lot of evidence of selectivity.  It looks they sell everything.  Anyway, I liked how it looked.<br><br>It was an interesting walk.  Tokyo's streets have a strange rhythm.  You can be in a place like Shibuya one minute, with 3,000 people crossing the road every time the green man lights up, and five minutes away it can be very quiet.  The most extraordinary contrast was in a spot on the way called Harajuku, which is a bit of a hip kids weekend hangout (I think).  There was a really narrow street there which was standing room only.  I don't think there was anything in particular going on, just that it was Saturday.  Five minutes round the corner, not a soul.  It would have been no surprise to see someone hanging out their washing.  You don't really get that sort of contrast in any other city I know, at least not in such short distances.
