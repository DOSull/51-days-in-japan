I'm posting this one just because I like it, and I promised something more serene. 

Thus [Great Egret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Egret) was mooching around in the pond at the temple shrine place in [Ueno](http://g.co/maps/f5jw5). Ueno itself is one of the close-in satellite centres with the regulation umpteen subway and train lines and more shopping than New Zealand (or pretty close, I would guess). But it has a big park, and I was on my way to the [National Museum of Western Art](http://www.nmwa.go.jp/en/) and there was the egret. 

Just had another [tremor in Chiba](http://www.jma.go.jp/en/quake/20120429193155389-291928.html), a 5.8. Room wobbling a little for a few seconds.

I liked the museum. Good impressionists (Manet, Monet, Degas), lots of Rodin, and a really cool [Miro](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_barber/6138707240/). An interesting building too, by Corbusier. Probably a sign of how influential he has been that it just seemed like a well put together modern building&mdash;and it was built in 1958.

A nice afternoon until the incident with the plug adapter!
