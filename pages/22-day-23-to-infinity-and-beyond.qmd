Interesting day today. Went to Roppongi, which is another of those districts that is about as big as any normal city would be but in context is just a kind of Tokyo version of St Lukes. This area's apparently quite big with the diplomatic set, and there are a lot of art galleries and such. I went to the [Roppongi Hills Mori Tower](http://www.roppongihills.com/en/) which is one of the taller buildings in Tokyo and has a 54th floor observatory and an art gallery.

The picture is from the observatory. A reasonably clear day, but the city extends so far in all directions that it does all tend to blur into one as you look into the distance. Probably better at night.

The art gallery was good. There was exhibition of [Lee Bul's](http://www.leebul.com/) a Korean sculptor of some note, who has exhibited at MoMA in New York and the rest. Very impressive stuff. Unfortunately not allowed to take photos&mdash;there's a [website for the exhibition here](http://www.mori.art.museum/english/contents/leebul/index.html) if you're interested.

Most of the locals were attending another exhibition which seemed to be something to do with anime pirates called ['One Piece'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece). Faced with a choice between Lee Bul and One Piece and not really having much of a clue what either of them was, I'm glad I picked the right one (for me).

The National Art Centre is also there (in the same area, not the same building), so I'll have to go back, I think.

Anyhow, after that, got back to ground level and inevitably got a bit lost, in the complex multi-level buildings at the bottom, but did stop off for lunch in an Indonesian place, very good.
