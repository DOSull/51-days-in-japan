This is Asimo, the Honda-designed and built robot (and all we got was this dumb car) at [Miraikan](http://www.miraikan.jst.go.jp/en/), the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation. He does two ten minute shows a day and then disappears again, up to who knows what backstage. Impressive all in all. A bit over four feet tall and he kicked a football to a lucky child volunteer. Walks in a very human sort of way and in between times stands absolutely still. Also talks, dances and waves. I took some video footage, so we can look at that when I get home.

Lots of other good stuff at Miraikan, particularly a huge suspended globe covered in a 10 million LED pixel array that they can display moving satellite images and other spatial data onto. It must have been 5 metres diameter, maybe more. I'll post a picture of it tomorrow. Very impressive. In general the museum was very good and a bit less like a theme park than a lot of museums seem to have become lately.

In an odd part of town across the harbour on reclaimed land, with lots of large buildings quite widely separated. I felt quite exposed after weeks of narrow streets and tall buildings. I also saw my first huge car park of the trip. There had to be cars somewhere, I suppose.

Now, if Asimo could just hold my umbrella, we could head into the future together.
