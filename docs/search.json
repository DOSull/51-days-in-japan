    "text": "I’m posting this one just because I like it, and I promised something more serene.\nThus Great Egret was mooching around in the pond at the temple shrine place in Ueno. Ueno itself is one of the close-in satellite centres with the regulation umpteen subway and train lines and more shopping than New Zealand (or pretty close, I would guess). But it has a big park, and I was on my way to the National Museum of Western Art and there was the egret.\nJust had another tremor in Chiba, a 5.8. Room wobbling a little for a few seconds.\nI liked the museum. Good impressionists (Manet, Monet, Degas), lots of Rodin, and a really cool Miro. An interesting building too, by Corbusier. Probably a sign of how influential he has been that it just seemed like a well put together modern building—and it was built in 1958.\nA nice afternoon until the incident with the plug adapter!",

    "text": "I said that I went wandering in the imperial palace park at the centre of the city on Sunday. Looking at my guide book I think I probably missed ssme of the better bits, because I was rushing a bit to get back for a ‘date’ with Fintan… anyway, it was still pretty impressive. Not the least of it was the strangely calm park with really very few people and not much happening, contrasted with the general mayhem and crowds that you tend to run into everywhere else you go. This picture shows a part of the gate complex near the entrance, with Nihombashi the financial district looming not far off behind. I think that big block is the HQ of the Sumitomo-Mitsui Banking Corporation and there is a lot of that just a (long) stone’s throw away across the still-impressive moat that surrounds the palace complex.\nIt’s a bit like an odd cross between the City of London and the financial district in Manhattan. They have the old building part of London, but across the road its long skyscraper canyons, rather than London’s maze of streets.\nOn the left you can see the walls that make the outer ramparts of the complex. They’re made out of huge blocks of stone. They’ve been restoring them, but even where they are damaged, they’re still impressive considering that some of it goes back to the seventeenth century.\nOn a Sunday they close off the road around this to traffic except cyclists and then ruin the experience for pedestrians by insisting that you still use the crossings—$which are still set to their miserly long-timing cycles for when it’s busy with traffic.\nOff tomorrow to stock up on more pictures for the week ahead. Maybe by then the camera’s GPS will have caught up to where I am; this shot is showing Shinjuku from the day before—it really is rubbish at getting a fix.",

    "text": "This just in from the blase about museums desk…\nYou could post a picture every day for a decade of a slightly wonky sign somewhere in Tokyo. Given the parlous (that would be nonexistent) state of my Japanese this is not mocking, I just found the directness of this sign, in front of the National Museum, rather amusing. I was half expecting to see a shark’s fin cruising around in there.\nThe museum itself was rather fine. Enormously generously proportioned in a city where space is at a premium, but all the better for it. And full of very beautiful things, very much along the lines you might expect: Japanese swords with their fantastic gentle curves, ceramics, lacquerware, kimonos, masks, wall hangings, screens, fans, and so on. I was a bit lacking for context to put it all in, but it was still a diverting hour or two.\nWhat is rather odd is how that gracious, classic aesthetic can possibly go with the general aesthetic craziness of contemporary Japan. I can see the classic ‘zen’ aesthetic in things like Muji, Miyake, CdG, but it’s harder to spot in Fridgeezoo animals (which are comparatively tasteful), manga, anime, neon, and the general visual and aural assault that is wandering around Tokyo of an afternoon. There must be some interesting theories on how that works. It’s the same contradiction between the calm, ordered, Muji-storage-nirvana and the piles of crazy junk that you can buy everywhere.\nOh well, just enjoy it while I’m still here.\nThis evening in Tokyu Hands, Shinjuku (not my favourite branch but certainly my favourite store—if they opened one in Auckland, about half a dozen NZ chains would be out of business overnight) I saw make-your-own snowglobe equipment. Not novelty kits, equipment, which suggests that people have this as a hobby. If I were seeing Caro any time soon, I’d have been tempted…",

This seems to be true even if the restaurant is fairly fancy, and most of the time the photography looks like a MacDonalds menu more than anything else, so you can’t help but think that the real thing will be disappointing compared to the (generally awful) pictures. Mostly, I think it’s the other way around: the real thing is better than the pictures.\nBy the way my guess is that the price is 150¥ (Yen) per skewer, not the whole plate or you’d not find me eating anywhere else.\nUnder-promise, over-deliver, the secret to successful business.",

I have quite a number of photos of carp in my camera, but this is the best taken just a couple of days ago at the Sensō-ji temple complex in Asakusa.\nI stopped off there on the way back into town from far-flung Kashiwa where I’d been dropping off keys and returning health insurance and ID cards and signing yet more forms (even unto the last day). Asakusa has been a tourist spot for years because of the huge temple (you’ll have to wait until I get home for those pictures), various knick-knacks in numerous shops (including the plastic food menu items). It’s now even more of a draw because it’s close to the Sky Tree, which opened on 22 May and had 1.6 million visitors in its first week (you pick your lower jaw up off the floor now).\nAnyhow, there are always koi (Japanese carp or nishikigoi) in the ponds in the ceremonial gardens. The ones at Ueno Park seem to have reverted to a duller colour, probably because the crows and herons would soon eat them all if they were this brightly coloured. These are the most brightly coloured I’ve seen. According to wikipedia, they recognise people and can be trained to eat from your hand. There are spas where you can have them nibble your toes.\nOdd that the Japanese will eat almost anything from the sea, but these guys are sacrosanct.\nSo that’s it from me from Japan.

This area’s apparently quite big with the diplomatic set, and there are a lot of art galleries and such. I went to the Roppongi Hills Mori Tower which is one of the taller buildings in Tokyo and has a 54th floor observatory and an art gallery.\nThe picture is from the observatory. A reasonably clear day, but the city extends so far in all directions that it does all tend to blur into one as you look into the distance. Probably better at night.\nThe art gallery was good. There was exhibition of Lee Bul’s a Korean sculptor of some note, who has exhibited at MoMA in New York and the rest. Very impressive stuff. Unfortunately not allowed to take photos—there’s a website for the exhibition here if you’re interested.\nMost of the locals were attending another exhibition which seemed to be something to do with anime pirates called ‘One Piece’. Faced with a choice between Lee Bul and One Piece and not really having much of a clue what either of them was, I’m glad I picked the right one (for me).\nThe National Art Centre is also there (in the same area, not the same building), so I’ll have to go back, I think.\nAnyhow, after that, got back to ground level and inevitably got a bit lost, in the complex multi-level buildings at the bottom, but did stop off for lunch in an Indonesian place, very good.",

I was heading to the kitchen at about 7:05, and ran into Per Arne Rikvold a physicist from Florida State (from Norway originally). Per was very excited because an eclipse was coming at 7:34. So had a quick shower and got my camera. Suddenly, the annoying misalignment of the residence worked to our advantage. You see all the big windows are on the east side of the building, pointlessly lighting the corridor, while the west-facing rooms are like caves in the mornings. But one of the big corridor windows was a perfect vantage point. It was a little cloudy, and I would need a filter to get a good picture. I’ve done what I can with the computer to enhance the image, but it still only gives an impression.\nWhat surprised me, compared to the TV coverage we’ve seen of these is that it didn’t get really dark. Partly, that may be the clouds scattering the light, and also making the contrast between full sun and eclipse less dramatic, but mostly, I think the TV footage makes it look darker than it really gets: it’s more a twilight effect. It was still pretty exciting though!\nThe Japanese characters in the title mean solar eclipse and translate as ‘day eater’ or similar. Per has been coming here for years and has pretty good Japanese.

The Tsukiji Wholesale fish market has a first-come first-ticketed (starting at 5am) policy for the tuna auctions. I wasn’t interested in that because it’s before the subway opens and seemed like a bit of a lottery (who wants to get up at 4 only to be disappointed?). But I did want to go to the fish market, so I set the alarm for 5 and decided to see how I felt when it went off. Not so bad I couldn’t get up, so I headed off. It’s about twenty minutes from here on the Oedo line.\nWell… what a place. As usual in Tokyo, enormous. Clearly a working market and not really for tourists. I somehow managed not to be given one of the leaflets they were handing out at the entrance which indicated that the wholesale market area is closed to visitors until 9:00 (it was about 6:15), and ended up wandering in there. It’s pretty hair-raising: dozens of electric buggy transport things that are pinging around at top speed (nearest thing I’ve seen to a traffic jam while here). Lots of stalls, lots of fish of all shapes and sizes. Huge knives, and lots of business going on.\nAnyway, I was taking photos, and then got shoulder-tapped by a very affable security person, who gave me one of the leaflets I had missed out on and pointed out my mistake. Oh well, I got some pictures anyhow, and it would otherwise have been a slightly disappointing more touristy market area that I’d have been restricted to. Still interesting, but rather sanitised—places selling only sushi seaweed, bowls, implements and so forth, but not actual fish!\nFairly amazing the see this all happening and to think that meals like the one in yesterday’s photo had probably been in Tsukiji that morning and in the ocean not long before that.",

I just don’t know where it all goes! It made (sort of) sense in the US (but not really) where everyone had a 3000 sq ft monster house to fill it up with crap.

By the way it may interest you to know that Muji now sell houses too.\nAnyway, this thing I get. It appeals to my inner geek. It’s a 100th scale model of dinosaurs. They sell all sorts of things in this range. I think you have to put it together yourself, but it’s hard to tell. They’re not that expensive, so maybe I should get one (so we can fill out huge house with rubbish too…). What makes this a little strange is that these things are presented as architectural models. I’m not really sure why an architect would need a bumper pack of 1/100th scale T-Rexs to add to his model of a house. It wouldn’t really be for scale, since noone’s ever seen a real one. So I think, although it is presented as architectural, it’s a hobby thing.\nBut there you have it: somewhat cool, slightly obsessive, and more than a little weird.\nIn other news, I have been invited to a ‘beer party’ on Thursday, and after a meeting with a professor (annoyingly out at Kashiwa) on Saturday next week, also for dinner, all the way back across town in Yoyogi.

I need to meet them, I think.\nThey close the main street off to traffic on Sundays so it it’s not such a bad place for a stroll if you like your strolls with extra people.\nI had my first minor subway mishap here getting on an express not a local when I headed back to Hongo-Sanchome, but fortunately figured out a recovery plan and survived. I’ll be more careful next time.",

Mostly, it doesn’t quite work, because oddly, a lot of it is not kept very well. In the evening, that’s less obvious, and this is the one axis where it actually does do exactly what it says on the tin.\nThe campus is pretty popular with dog walkers. Most of the dogs have outfits, and anything bigger than a labrador puppy is unusual, although I did see an Alsatian taking its owner for a walk the other day.",

    "text": "So before the eclipse so rudely interrupted, I had been going to post this picture from the Science Museum of the Geo-Cosmos exhibit, which is the giant globe-shaped LED display mounted in the mezzanine space between the 3rd and 5th floors, and suspended above the 1st, so there were people down below gawking up at it as well. The scale is a little hard to fathom, unless you see it live, but it must be 5 metres diameter, and it’s covered in the latest, greatest LED display technology, which is doubtless coming to a TV set near you some day soon, so you’ll have to throw you’re only recently acquired flat screen and buy something else.\nAnyway, even post-eclipse, in retrospect it was still impressive. Easy to get a little off-hand about all this stuff after a while. There is a lot of it around in this city. Of note, is the crowd. This is about as many people as I have seen in a museum since I’ve been here. They’re pretty good places for escaping from the crowds, believe it or not. I don’t know what people do on the weekend, but it’s not go to museums. Shop, would have to be my guess, so not much different from Aucklanders then…\nIt was raining all day today. Bit of a rubbish day really, with that and hitting a bit of roadblock writing chapter 4.",

You can tell, because that’s the station in red text, with no number beside it. The numbers tell you how many minutes to each stop. You look at where you are going. I was heading for Yushima, one of four stationswithin about ten minutes walk of campus—the others are Hongo-Sanchome, Nezu and Todaimae. I only got around to using Nezu for the first time today.\nAnyway look across from for the station you are heading to, and it tells you which car to get in on the train so that you are near the exits or the escalator for changing lines depending on what you want to do. This tells me that my destination is 15 minutes away (which is pretty much exactly how long it will take, and that cars 1 or 10 are near the exits. If I read Japanese, then I imagine that there is more detail about which exits each end of the train are nearest to. It means you can be using the system like a long-time resident in no time. It took me about two years in London to remember which cars to get in for rapid exit at different stations.",

I’m looking forward to that meeting—everyone here still speaks very highly of him, and most of them were taught by him. He wrote (with others) the book Spatial Tessellations, which is almost the platonic ideal of an authorative academic work.

This is a view along the side of one of the buildings on campus, and I can only assume that this is earthquake reinforcement. It almost looks like there is a big steel frame and the building is suspended inside that. It can’t do a whole lot for the views from inside-yes those are windows that people might want to look out of running along on the left hand side of the picture.\nQuite a few of the buildings look like they might have had this sort of thing done later as an add-on (a clip-on, if you will…) although some of them probably have it as an architectural ‘feature’, I think.\nI prefer the glass bricks.\nPS Oddly enough there was a bit of a rumble early in the morning after I posted this—a 5.5.",

This is about the first time in a week that the lights have been properly visible, there has been so much rain. If I’d taken this any time in the last week it would’ve just been grey murk.\nThe wheel is a ferris wheel, and you can dimly also make out a rollercoaster, although I’ve not actually seen that in operation. There is also a log flume at the complex which is called Laqua, and includes Seijo Ishii where I’ve been getting essential things European. They’ve al handily got brand labels in roman lettering, but all the instructions and details have stuck on additional labels in Japanese. Fair enough, they live here, after all.\nThat whole complex is about a kilometre from me, maybe a bit more. The tall building is a hotel. And the thing that looks vaguely like Vector Arena is the Tokyo Dome which is a 42,000 seat baseball stadium.\nI’m looking forward to more clear skies over the next week. They surely couldn’t be any less clear than they’ve been. Maybe I’ll get over my umbrella fixation.\nOh yeah, the crane in the foreground is pretty typical. There’s a fair amount of small scale building going on round and about. They have to cram these tall cranes onto tiny sites. It’s a pity it’s in the way of the picture, really!",

I was actually taking these for the book as much as anything—we are using photographs of relevant scenes to talk about things you might use particular types of model to represent, and pedestrians are one of those things.\nI set off from here and walked via Harajuku and Yoyogi to Shinjuku on Saturday. An interesting stretch of city with more going on than you could shake a stick at. Harajuku was particularly insane. I’ll see if I managed to get a good picture of that for tomorrow.\nI added a map link to the website template to see how that works. I think it would work OK if the GPS on my camera coped better with getting a decent fix in the city. A known problem with GPS: all those tall buildings make it hard to get a reliable location fix.

Or something. Anyway, clearly a must-have for any adult lifestyle in the den. Or perhaps not. This item was on ‘open sale’ which I took to mean that they would welcome any offers to take it off their hands.

A more down-to-earth sort of place than Shinjuku or Shibuya, it seemed a bit more down-at-heel, and definitely had a slightly seamier side to the north of the station. I failed to find the place I was looking for, but will go back.\nCurrently desperate to get a picture of someone in a mask.

It’s just next to a big railway viaduct several tracks across which are going into Tokyo JR station, and there’s a whole succession of tiny little bars under the arches. I imagine they are full of salary-men at the end of the working day during the week grabbing a quick drink or several before the last train home—bit like London, really. Another block over and you’re on to the main drag through Ginza which is offices and lot of upmarket shopping.",

He does two ten minute shows a day and then disappears again, up to who knows what backstage. Impressive all in all. A bit over four feet tall and he kicked a football to a lucky child volunteer. Walks in a very human sort of way and in between times stands absolutely still. Also talks, dances and waves. I took some video footage, so we can look at that when I get home.\nLots of other good stuff at Miraikan, particularly a huge suspended globe covered in a 10 million LED pixel array that they can display moving satellite images and other spatial data onto. It must have been 5 metres diameter, maybe more. I’ll post a picture of it tomorrow. Very impressive. In general the museum was very good and a bit less like a theme park than a lot of museums seem to have become lately.\nIn an odd part of town across the harbour on reclaimed land, with lots of large buildings quite widely separated. I felt quite exposed after weeks of narrow streets and tall buildings. I also saw my first huge car park of the trip. There had to be cars somewhere, I suppose.\nNow, if Asimo could just hold my umbrella, we could head into the future together.",

It’s underground, and you walk across this ‘bridge’ over the seating area beneath on both sides, arriving at the ‘menu’ which is actually a display case full of numbered plastic replicas of the meals available. You then go to a vending machine punch in the number, pay, and get a ticket which you take to one of the service counters down below. It’s really very strange, but quite endearing, and the food is cheap, good and fairly plentiful too. I should try and get a shot with a proper camera (this was my phone), as this doesn’t really give the full effect. Even so, you can probably appreciate how very, uh…, Japanese this is.",

I think there are three kinds of tuna, salmon, octopus, squid, bonito and a couple of other things on here too. All just as good to eat as they look. This was a nice bar-restaurant, but it didn’t seem overly swanky, relatively straightforward. Amazingly filling to eat, and they take their time over the food. All that moving it from plate to bowl, to soy sauce, all with chopsticks takes time. A nice ritual and a nicely slowed down way to be in at-times rather frantic place.

As that link shows there are quite a few of them around it wouldn’t make a bad project to try to visit them all. I’ve seen two this year (there’s one on 6th Avenue), hurrah for me!\nThis is in Shinjuku, last weekend, looking uncharacteristically sunny, and also uncharacteristically empty. The emptiness is deceptive, there are probably 5000 people underneath the ground I’m standing on, it being that kind of place.\nNot far from here I found the Paul Bassett Australian coffee place, after quite a bit of searching, and having alost given up on it. Why are things always in the last place you look? (Riddle for you there, Fintan.) It did a decent flat white, but nothing really to write home about (Australian, after all…), and I’m not so surprised as all that that he has closed two of his three Tokyo outlets, if they’re all as hard to find as this one!\nThis was also near the Sompo Gallery with the $40,000,000 Van Gogh Sunflowers, from back in the bubble years. Impressive picture, but a bit over-priced, I feel. The gallery was disappointing as its permanent collection of Seiji Togo’s works (probably Japan’s premier impressionist-post-impressionist 20th century painter) was locked away to allow a ho-hum impressionist exhibition of Le Sidaner (who he?) which was pleasant enough, but nothing I hadn’t seen before. There I go getting blasé about art galleries. More to come on that front tomorrow…",

There are some other oddities arising from the same cause—umbrellas, that is, not the low crime rate.

I don’t see a whole lot of evidence of selectivity. It looks they sell everything. Anyway, I liked how it looked.\nIt was an interesting walk. Tokyo’s streets have a strange rhythm. You can be in a place like Shibuya one minute, with 3,000 people crossing the road every time the green man lights up, and five minutes away it can be very quiet. The most extraordinary contrast was in a spot on the way called Harajuku, which is a bit of a hip kids weekend hangout (I think). There was a really narrow street there which was standing room only. I don’t think there was anything in particular going on, just that it was Saturday. Five minutes round the corner, not a soul. It would have been no surprise to see someone hanging out their washing. You don’t really get that sort of contrast in any other city I know, at least not in such short distances.",

I’ve been trying to get a picture the whole time I’ve been here, and finally one of them stayed still enough for long enough, and also in a well-lit spot. When they’re in the shade they sort of swallow up all the light like a Lord of the Rings black rider, and you get rubbish photos.\nAnyway, that’s about the size of it. Apparently they are a problem, although I suspect only if you decide you don’t like them much. As usual, when an animal is doing well around humans, it is generally the humans who are to blame. Here, with 30 million people in a not very big area, there is a lot of garbage, and surprisingly, most of it is left out in plastic bags for collection. The council made some sort of rule about the bags being transparent, and crows are pretty smart, so they do well out of this arrangement. Bins would probably solve the problem, but might be difficult to deal with in Tokyo’s narrow and oomplicated streets, although like I said, crows are pretty smart, really smart, so they might figure bins out, anyway.\nThere has been war on the crows for some years now, but I don’t think they’re having much luck.\nThere’s been an arthouse documentary about it all called Tokyo Waka which looks really interesting.\nI like them. They know what they are about and they look pretty cool too. Of course, I might feel a bit differently if one attacked me, which apparently does happen during breeding season…",

There had been something brewing for a week or two when a temporary construction site appeared on my walk to the office, and then a couple of days ago lots of frantic activity started with students in syncrhonised T-shirts showing up at the construction hut and painting, hammering, sawing, and generally up to something. Turns out they were building stalls and display boards.\nThen yesterday seemingly 200+ food stalls got assembled overnight—not super-interesting food, but a fair variety—and since this morning it’s been all go. I’ve seen the UT double dutch team (yes skipping and rapping, look it up boys), their glee club, their South American music club, a couple of indie bands, traditional drummers, the lacrosse team, and people dressed up as pandas, carrots, manga characters, in kimonos, boys in kimonos, and more or less everyone wearing various club T-shirts (many of them in amusing Janglish).\nI think there is another day of it tomorrow. They do nothing by halves here.\nThe photo was taken through a long horizontal slot in the outer wall of Fukutake Hall which is one of the few genuinely interesting buildings on the campus, even if it doesn’t look like much. Anyway, the camera’s panorama view did its best, but of course, the people are moving, so it doesn’t really work. A bit different though.

You can buy the masks in packs of seven (obviously) and they aren’t that expensive. It makes you feel very self-conscious about coughing or even clearing your throat, when other people are going to this sort of trouble.

It’s quite something, and it’s nothing like as deranged as Shinjuku, which I will have to brave some night to get a similar picture. Still thousands of people out and about, up to I’m not really sure what, but all seemingly enjoying themselves.\nYou can see why the sci-fi people take so much inspiration from Tokyo, although at the same time, for me at least, it’s hard to see why they always use it as a dystopian vision—this is really cool, if you ask me. If this is what urban super-density makes, then let’s have more of it, is what I say. What’s not to like?\nIt’s funny to think that all the energy being saved on not driving everywhere seems to have been diverted into neon…\nThe meal was Italian in a place called Chiasso, and was very good. My first alcohol in a while, over three weeks, and I found myself to be drinking slowly. Interesting.\nI saw Prof Asami’s home, which was also interesting, not as small as I had imagined it might be, especially considering that they live only two stops from Shibuya, and so are really very central. He grew up in the neighbourhood, went to the same elementary school as his five year old daughter attends now, and his wife is from Shibuya, so a local girl. Tokyo-ites, I suppose, and perhaps that’s how they are lucky enough to be in a reasonable size of a place (like born and bred Londoners).\nSangen-jaya was a really nice neighbourhood. The main station entrance and immediate surrounds rather blighted by a huge motorway overpass but duck down a side-street and within seconds you wouldn’t know it was there, and the place is full of little locally owned shops, bars, restaurants and so on. They do that a lot—put rail or road on stilts down the middle of other major roads. It shouldn’t really work, but on the other hand, all it does is add some more hubbub to an already busy place, and maybe that’s better than carving things through residential neighbourhoods, just making the disruption extend even further.\nAnyway, time for bed.",

And the temperature had dropped about 10 degrees. The way it was raining and me under-equipped I might have had to camp out, but it ended more or less as quickly as it had started, and I took my chance and headed back to the station (I already had my airfare money safely in my wallet by then…).\nAnyway, as promised yesterday, this is in Harajuku, famed for Gwen Stefani’s ‘Harajuku Girls’ which isn’t really what it sounds like—a tribute to the Japanese teen fashion scene, really.

That’s just the obvious shops with their own frontage. There are several flash malls on the same strip and that’s before you even get into the sidestreets which are full of boutiques. All of it is of course eye-wateringly expensive. Hard to say if anyone actually buys anything or not, but there’s a fair amount of foot traffic on the weekend.\nThis is where the private university Aoyama Gakuin that Atsu Okabe teaches at now is to be found. I expect that keeping the (presumably) wealthy students ‘off the streets’ is a challenge. He and his wife were lovely when I met them last night, very friendly and keen that my family come over next time, so we can all go walking in the mountains.
